                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm Justin Spanos. I grew up in the enchanting landscapes of Central Florida 
                    but have been fortunate to explore both the country and other corners of the world. 
                    My academic journey is diverse, holding an A.A. degree with a focus on audio engineering and an A.S. 
                    certificate in Computer Programming. My thirst for knowledge drives me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in 
                    Computer Science. Beyond academics, I find solace in the arts 
                    â€“ reading, writing, and sketching are my cherished pastimes.
                <br><br>
                These three sections provide a comprehensive overview of my diverse interests and experiences, encompassing 
                both the technical and creative realms. I'm excited to continue exploring and innovating in the worlds of technology, 
                music, and multimedia content creation.</p>

                <h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>
                    My journey into the world of coding has been both enriching and dynamic. 
                    While I may have only dabbled in freelance web design, I've honed my skills during two significant internships. At D.M.E., 
                    I diligently maintained their documentation and crafted web pages in SharePoint using HTML and CSS. 
                    This experience also exposed me to the intricate workings of the MVC and agile model. 
                    My time at Brown and Brown was equally illuminating. As part of an intern group project, 
                    we harnessed Azure DevOps to extract meta data, visualizing it with Power BI to enhance business processes. 
                    My technical skills include Python, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Azure DevOps, and Power BI.
                </p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="about-music">
                <h3>Music and Audio Technology</h3>
                <p>Music has been an integral part of my life. I started writing lyrics around 8 years oldand, and in 2007, 
                    picked up the guitar, igniting a lifelong passion. My musical skillset has expanded to include bass, piano, 
                    ukulele, and have recently been learning the banjo. I possess a strong foundation in music theory and instrumentation.<br><br>

                    Beyond creating music, I've also ventured into the realm of live audio engineering. For a period, 
                    I was the audio engineer for a local church, where I was responsible for delivering pristine sound 
                    experiences during live services.<br><br>
                    
                    In addition to music and coding, I have a creative side that shines 
                    when working on original pieces for short video content. These projects have allowed me to combine my 
                    passion for music and storytelling, creating impactful and memorable audiovisual experiences.
